    "hello": "Hello,",
    "p1": "My name is Hugo Leonardo and I am a Full Stack Developer from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Since 2020, I have been working as a web developer with a strong focus on frontend development. I led a team of three frontend developers, a tester, and a designer, where we successfully built a new product and maintained an existing one. Our work involved meticulous planning and prioritizing using backlog grooming at the start of each sprint. We documented everything on Confluence and tracked tasks with Jira and Gitflow. During my tenure, we managed to eliminate all bugs in the existing application, allowing us to deliver a new module for students in record time. This role greatly enhanced my project and team management skills.",
    "p2": "For the past two years, I have worked for an American company serving a client in the fiduciary sector, a complex field involving national security issues. Initially, I focused on test automation using Cypress and jQuery, which was very motivating. However, when my role shifted to manual testing, it no longer aligned with my career aspirations as a programmer. After careful consideration, I decided to seek new opportunities.",
    "p3": "Recently, I dedicated a few months to a full stack personal project. As a skater in my spare time, I noticed the lack of a quality website for the skating community. Most available sites were poorly designed or just online stores. This led me to create Rollers Hub, an application aimed at connecting skaters worldwide. Developed with the support of a community of skaters, I continue to enhance the site with new features in my free time.",
    "p4": "I am currently seeking a position as a full stack web developer where I can apply my skills and continue to grow professionally. I have a particular interest in [Company Name] because [specific reason related to the company or role]. I am confident that my experience in team leadership, test automation, and full stack development makes me a strong candidate for this position. I am excited to work with you and look forward to joining your team!",
    "p5": "Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team.",
